# 5 Easy steps to getting started with Drupal on Koding

**What is Drupal?**
Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications. Itâ€™s built, used, and supported by an active and diverse community of people around the world. [Learn more](http://drupal.org).

Getting started with your own Drupal environment on Koding is as simple as following these 5 easy steps!

**Step 1: **

logged into your [Koding account](https://koding.com/Login) in order to run the app.]
