# What happens when you upgrade your Koding account?
In general, upgrading your account gives you access to more compute and storage resources when ever you upgrade. Compute resources are RAM and CPU and storage is disk space. Our [Pricing Page](https://koding.com/Pricing) details the various options you have available for upgrading.

Primary benefits of upgrading are:
1. ability to run more VMs
2. have one (ore more) always-on VM
3. get more compute resources (CPU and RAM)
4. get more storage
5. get priority support
6. your VMs will be hosted on premium servers which are less prone to downtime as they are separated from the servers that run our free accounts.

Also, please note the following:
1. When you upgrade, compute and storage resources are shared across your VM's. It does not mean that each of your VM's will get the specified compute and storage resources. For e.g. if you have 3 vm's on your koding account, all three together will share the upgraded compute resources. So depending on the type of tasks you run on your VM, even after an upgrade, you still may see the "CPU limit reached" message.
2. Similar to CPU, RAM (Memory) is also shared between your running VMs. Each VM starts with allocated memory. If you have 10GB limit, you can run 10VMs at 1GB, or 3 x 3GB or 1 x 10GB.
