# What happens upon upgrade?

In this short guide we'll cover some of the basic stuff that will happen upon upgrade of your Koding account.

There are 5 available packages to chose from. Each one of them includes improvements to your free Koding account. Bellow you'll find some details about the packages you choose.

Each plan improves your account by giving you access to the following resources:

1. Extra CPUs that will run any process you throw at them. Your CPUs are shared among all your running VMs. If you run only one VM, all CPUs will be utilized; if you have 10 VMs running, they will share your available CPUs.
2. Extra RAM that can certainly suit your needs of extra memory when running a lot processes. Memory is shared between your running VMs. Each VM starts with allocated memory. If you have 10GB limit, you can run 10VMs at 1GB, or 3 x 3GB or 1 x 10GB.
3. More disk space where you can store all your important projects. This is local storage allocated to your VMs. You can distribute this quota across all of your VMs as you need. You can allocate 40GB of disk space to one of your VMs, for instance, and to the next one you could allocate 10GB.

This will assure that when you have to present something to a client, or you're hosting your personal website, the VM you mark as always-on will work 24/7, however the others will be powered off automatically 15 minutes after you log out.
