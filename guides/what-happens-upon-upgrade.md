# What happens when you upgrade your Koding account?
In general, upgrading your account gives you access to more compute and storage resources when ever you upgrade. Compute resources are RAM and CPU and storage is disk space. Our [Pricing Page](https://koding.com/Pricing) details the various options you have available for upgrading.

Primary benefits of upgrading are:
1. ability to run more VMs
2. have one (ore more) always-on VM
3. get more compute resources (CPU and RAM)
4. get more storage
5. get priority support
6. your VMs will be hosted on premium servers which are less prone to downtime as they are separated from the servers that run our free accounts.

Also, please note the following:
1. When you upgrade, compute and storage resources are shared across your VM's. It does not mean that each of your VM's will get the specified compute and storage resources. For e.g. if you have 3 vm's on your koding account, all three together will share the upgraded compute resources. So depending on the type of tasks you run on your VM, even after an upgrade, you still may see the "CPU limit reached" message.
2. Similar to CPU, RAM (Memory) is also shared between your running VMs. Each VM starts with allocated memory. If you have 10GB limit, you can run 10VMs at 1GB, or 3 x 3GB or 1 x 10GB.

# What happens upon upgrade?

You just upgraded your account, awesome (and thanks!) but what happens now?

Based on the type of resource pack you selected on the [Pricing page][pricing] you now have access to more resources as compared to your free Koding account. Below is a list of the resources that have been upgraded.

### CPU

CPU resources available to your account have been upgraded. More compute power ftw!! Note: CPUs are shared among all your running VMs. If you run only one VM, all CPU will be utilized by that one VM; if you have 10 VMs running, they will share your available CPU resources across the 10.

### Storage (Disk)

You can distribute this quota across all of your VMs as you need. For e.g. If you have upgraded to get 40GB of storage, you can allocate this 40GB of disk space to one of your VMs or distribute the storage across your VMs.

### Memory (RAM)

Just like CPU and storage, memory/RAM is also shared between your running VMs. Each VM starts with allocated memory. If you have 10GB limit, you can run 10VMs at 1GB, or 3 x 3GB or 1 x 10GB.

### Always on VMs

The maximum number of VMs that you can keep turned on 24/7. For example, you bought a package that comes with 10 VMs and one always-on VM. The VM you mark as always-on will work 24/7, however the others will be powered off automatically 15 minutes after you log out or 15 minutes of inactivity.

### Other Benefits

Besides the awesome features you get upon upgrade, your VMs get moved to premium infrastucture that will ensure your VMs stay on 24/7 and your data is secure.
